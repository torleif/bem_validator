/**
*
* BEM (Block Element Modifier) Validation Service.
* Read more about BEM here: http://getbem.com/
*
* Copy and paste your CSS into this text area.
*
* You can also drag and drop your CSS file into your browser. Your parsed BEM
* CSS structure will be shown on the right pane with any issues found. If an
* issue has been found, a red cross will also appear in the gutter of the editor.
*  Hover to reveal the what the error is, why it is an issue, and an example of
* how to fix it. Clicking on the red cross (or the CSS rule) will highlight the
* CSS rule and BEM violation details in the right pane of the validator.
*
* If you find any issues with the Validation Service, or want to talk about it,
* create an issue in gitlab.
*
* This Validation Service was created from iamdustan/reworkcss_ast_explorer,
* which is a fork from fkling/astexplorer. Thank you to the people who created
* the libraries: codemirror, css, keypress, pubsub-js and react.
